## Meet RuleBook

RuleBook was created as a simple and intuitive solution to untangle business rules from application logic.
RuleBook was built for developers. It provides a simple, but powerful rules abstraction that has an incredibly 
short learning curve. Rules can be built using a Camel-style \[Lambda enabled\] Java Domain Specific Language (DSL) 
or by using annotated POJOs. Rules are also executed in the way that developers expect. So, there's no 
guesswork or unpredictable behavior, which means developers can spend more time creating useful functionality and less 
time debugging. And unlike many other rules engines, RuleBook can be used to drive workflows, where the ordering of rules is important. 

RuleBook is Open Source under the Apache 2.0 License. It's 100% free to use. So, start simplifying your life and
streamlining your code. Start using [RuleBook](https://github.com/rulebook-rules/rulebook) today!
