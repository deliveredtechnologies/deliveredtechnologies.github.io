## Meet RuleBook

RuleBook was created as a simple and intuitive solution to untangle business rules from application logic.
RuleBook was built for developers. It provides a simple, but powerful and flexible rules abstraction that has an incredibly 
short learning curve. Rules can be built using a Camel-style \[Lambda enabled\] Java Domain Specific Language (DSL) 
or by using annotated POJOs. Rules are also executed in the way that developers expect. So, there's no 
guesswork or unpredictable behavior, which means developers can spend more time creating useful functionality and less 
time debugging. And unlike many other rules engines, RuleBook can be used to drive workflows, where the ordering of rules is important.

### RuleBook's Interface First Approach

The driving force behind RuleBook is that the interface should come first. This goes beyond simply defining
Java interfaces up front. It also means that how a rules engine is used \[by developers\]should not be an afterthought
that simply supports the underlying functionality. How it's used should be the first thing considered, and an important
factor, if not THE most important factor that drives development.
